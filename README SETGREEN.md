The system manages game scheduling for Scheduling Representatives and Referee Assignors. 
By sending invites through the system, the scheduling process is streamlined. The system
was made with the user in mind and provides a user-friendly way to digitally keep up with 
the schedule.

The system allows for a Scheduling representative to send a game invite directyly to an opponent.
The request includes the preferred date, time, and location of the match.
The opponent can then choose to accept or decline the match. 
If declined, the two parties can work out a better arrangement.
If approved, the game is sent to the Referee  Assignor for official apporval.
If the assinor is in a position to provide Referees for the match, the game will be approved and
added to the master schedule.
If not, the two teams must make an arrangement to find a better time.
